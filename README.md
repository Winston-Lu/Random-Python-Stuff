# Random Python Stuff 

A Repo to keep track of my python projects

## solver.py 
A simple brute-force method of solving sudoku puzzles I made as a joke for a friend doing sudoku puzzles. I also added some additional restrictions like knights-move and diagonal restrictions. With an empty board, all the restrictions will take quite a while to run, as the runtime is heavily dependent on how many available squares, and haivng an empty grid with all current restrictions took my machine a few hours. Nice proof of concept though, but extremely inefficient
